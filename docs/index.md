## About

I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Center for Watershed Sciences, UC Davis, working in close collaboration with the USDA Agricultural Research Serviceâ€™s Sustainable Agricultural Water Systems Research Unit. My research integrates environmental economics and applied econometrics to quantify the non-market values of ecosystem services at the intersection of water, agriculture, and conservation policy.

My current projects include:

- Estimating public willingness to pay for migratory bird habitat restoration on SGMA-retired agricultural lands in Californiaâ€™s Central Valley, with a focus on integrating non-market valuation into groundwater and land-use policy design.

- Assessing birdwatchersâ€™ willingness to pay for grassland habitat restoration in California, using survey-based valuation methods to connect recreational demand with habitat restoration and conservation planning.

Through this work, I aim to provide decision-makers with rigorous economic evidence to guide sustainable water management, land retirement, and conservation strategies in California and beyond.
