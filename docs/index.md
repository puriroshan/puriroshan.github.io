## About

I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Center for Watershed Sciences, University of California, Davis, working in close collaboration with the USDA Agricultural Research Serviceâ€™s Sustainable Agricultural Water Systems Research Unit.  

My research integrates **environmental economics** and **applied econometrics** to quantify the non-market values of ecosystem services at the intersection of land, water, agriculture, and conservation policy.

### Current Projects
- **Estimating public willingness to pay** for migratory bird habitat restoration on SGMA-retired agricultural lands in Californiaâ€™s Central Valley, with a focus on integrating non-market valuation into groundwater and land-use policy design.
  
- **Assessing birdwatchersâ€™ willingness to pay** for grassland habitat restoration in California, using survey-based valuation methods to connect recreational demand with habitat restoration and conservation planning.

Through these works, I aim to provide decision-makers with rigorous economic evidence to guide sustainable water management, land retirement, and conservation strategies in California and beyond.
